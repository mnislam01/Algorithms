# Linear Search

Linear Search algorithm is a straight-forward technique for searching. It looks for a value in a sorted/unsorted list/array one by one from the starting index to ending index. 

# Time Complexity Analysis

Worst Case:
The worst case is it have to look into the every item of list/array item of size 'n' for the value. The algorithms runs a for loop and it depends on 'n'.

So, the worst case is: O(n)
